# To Slices

Break a plan into independently-grabbable vertical slices (tracer bullets) and write them to the `.plans/` folder.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a plan folder path as an argument (e.g., `.plans/dark-mode`), read `prd.md` from that folder. Otherwise, look for the most recent `.plans/*/prd.md` or synthesize from conversation.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Slice titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Detect project skills

Scan the project for its stack and tooling, and note which skills (if any) the implementing agents should load for validation on each slice. Detect from the project's own signals — config files, manifests, lockfiles, existing test/lint/typecheck commands — and match against the skills installed in this environment. Record what you find so step 6 can name the right skills per slice. If the project has no relevant skills, the slice's validation is just its own native checks (build, test, lint).

### 4. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** slices. Each slice is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 5. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 6. Write the slice files

For each approved slice, write a markdown file to `.plans/<slug>/slices/`. Use zero-padded numbering: `01-short-name.md`, `02-short-name.md`, etc.

Write slices in dependency order (blockers first) so numbering reflects execution order. Follow
[SLICE-TEMPLATE.md](SLICE-TEMPLATE.md) for the structure of each file.

### 7. Update state.json

Update `.plans/<slug>/state.json` to include all slices, following the shape in
[example.state.json](example.state.json) — `slices` keyed by slice name, each with a `status` and a
`blocked_by` array naming its blocker slices.

Valid statuses: `pending`, `done`.

Do NOT modify `prd.md` or any other existing files in the plan folder.
